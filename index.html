                <h2>About BiS</h2>
                <p>
                    <p>Butterflies in Spirit (BiS) is a dance and advocacy/search group made up of Indigenous women and 2 Spirit peoples who are activists and performers advocating for the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-spirit people on Turtle Island and Latin America. We are survivors and family members of MMIWG2+ and the Disappeared who work to raise awareness about the injustices and discrimination faced by Indigenous Peoples. We channel our sadness and power into collective action against violence and in our presentations mix contemporary, decolonial, indigenous dance and hip-hop. In the different presentations and meetings throughout Turtle island and Abya Yala they have been able to identify similar tactics of displacement and violence against Indigenous women in other regions of the world, and this has helped to raise further awareness and to establish networks of solidarity
                    throughout the continent. Since 2018, we have collaborated with the national and International brigades for the disappeared in Mexico. The group was founded in 2012 during the time that the Commission of Inquiry into Missing Women in Canada was created. Since then, BIS has been invited to participate in more than 100 events locally and nationally, as well as international performances in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Colombia. In Canada, we have also been part of Truth and Reconciliation Day, National Day of Action for Missing and Murdered Indigneous Women, Girls and 2 Spirit+, and Vancouver Indigenous Fashion Week. BiS activism has led us to participate in searches, forums,marches, documentaries, interviews and other events related to the issue.</p>
